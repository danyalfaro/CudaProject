# PwdCrackerPerformance

This Repository consists of the files required to run performance tests in the comparison of CPU vs GPU Password cracking.



## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Download HashCat binaries found here:

```
https://hashcat.net/hashcat/
```

### Installing

To set up the environment, you only need the installation of HashCat as well as the provided hash files provided in the repository.

For this tests we will be using HashCat Version 5.1.0
First, download and unzip the HashCat binaries folder.


```
hashcat-5.1.0
```

Then, download and unzip this repository.

```
PwdCrackerPerformance-master
```

From here, you have two options to perform the tests.
The first option is to run the provided python code:

```
HashingProgram.py
```
to create new hashes and store them in text files,

or you can just copy paste the text files into the HashCat binaries folder.

After this, the environment is set-up for the tests.
